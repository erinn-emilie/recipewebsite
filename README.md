Current things we need to do:

Need to make a dialog modal that prompts the user to signup/login and save their recipe to their account or tells the user if something went wrong when saving a recipe
	(i.e., they've already saved that recipe). When this is finished it would be good to have cookies saved of the current generated recipe so it doesn't disappear when the user clicks off
	the page, though I feel like this is going to be an annoying process and maybe we skip it for now????

When users sign up it prompts them if the information they provided is invalid, but it should tell them which information is invalid, like if the username has been taken, the email
	is wrong, or their password is too short.

When users log in it should prompt them if their information is incorrect

After this need to start work on refactoring some of the React components, as the code needs cleaned up
Then, need to work on cleaning up the parsing of recipes and confirming that it works with all/most sites

Then, need to fix up the way the information for each recipe is displayed (i.e., )

THEN, can start on kitchen
